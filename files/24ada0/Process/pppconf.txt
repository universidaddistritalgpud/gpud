# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# It turns out that some receivers don't correct their clocks from drift.
# When this happens, their code observations may drift well beyond what it is
# usually expected from a pseudorange. In turn, this effect causes that
# "SimpleFilter" objects start to reject a lot of satellites.
# Thence, the "filterCode" option allows you to deactivate the "SimpleFilter"
# object that filters out C1, P1 and P2, in case you need to.

# Like in the "filterCode" case, the "filterPC" option allows you to deactivate
# the "SimpleFilter" object that filters out PC, in case you need to.
